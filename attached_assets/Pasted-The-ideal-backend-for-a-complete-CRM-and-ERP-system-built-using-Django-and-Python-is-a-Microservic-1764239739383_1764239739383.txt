The ideal backend for a complete CRM and ERP system, built using Django and Python, is a Microservices Architecture. This approach breaks the large system into smaller, independent, domain-specific services, ensuring scalability, resilience, and independent development.1The end-to-end setup requires a layered architecture that includes the core business services, communication infrastructure, and supporting platform services.🏗️ 1. Core Microservices (Django Applications)Each of the following business domains should be a separate, deployable Django service with its own database (Polyglot Persistence).2 They communicate via internal APIs.3🤝 CRM (Front-Office) ServicesService NamePrimary FeaturesKey Django Models & APIsContact ServiceMaster data management for Customers, Vendors, and Internal Employees. The Single Source of Truth for names, addresses, and account status.Contact, Account, Address. API: /api/v1/contacts/{id}Sales ServiceManages the sales cycle. Lead generation, Opportunity tracking (pipeline), Quoting, and Sales Forecasting.Lead, Opportunity, Quote, PipelineStage. API: /api/v1/opportunitiesSupport ServiceManages post-sales customer interactions. Case/Ticket Management, SLA tracking, and integration with the Knowledge Base.Ticket, SLA, CaseLog. API: /api/v1/tickets💼 ERP (Back-Office) ServicesService NamePrimary FeaturesKey Django Models & APIsOrder ServiceThe transactional hub. Manages Sales Orders (created from CRM Quotes), Purchase Orders, and Order Fulfillment status.SalesOrder, PurchaseOrder, LineItem. API: /api/v1/ordersInventory ServiceManages Products/Items, Stock Levels, Warehouse Locations, and Bill of Materials (BOM).Product, StockItem, Warehouse, InventoryTransaction. API: /api/v1/products/{sku}/stockFinance ServiceManages all monetary transactions. Invoicing, Accounts Receivable (AR), Accounts Payable (AP), and General Ledger entries.Invoice, Payment, GLJournal. API: /api/v1/invoicesHR ServiceManages internal employee data, payroll records, and leave requests.Employee, PayrollRecord, LeaveRequest. API: /api/v1/employees⚙️ 2. Platform & Infrastructure ServicesThese supporting services manage security, communication, data flow, and deployment across the microservices.🛡️ Authentication & SecurityAPI Gateway:The single entry point for all external traffic (frontend/mobile apps).4Handles Authentication (validating user tokens).5Routes the request to the correct internal microservice.6Performs rate limiting and logging.7Auth Service (Identity Service):A dedicated Django microservice using Django REST Framework (DRF) and Simple JWT for token-based authentication.Manages user creation, roles, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) across the entire system.8📬 Communication & Data Pipelines (The Integration Glue)Asynchronous Message Broker:Technology: RabbitMQ or Redis.Purpose: Decouples services and enables real-time data synchronization. Used for non-critical, delayed, or fan-out tasks.Example: When the Order Service creates a SalesOrder, it publishes a message.Task Queue:Technology: Celery (Python).9Purpose: Manages workers that consume messages from the broker to execute background tasks.Example: Celery workers consume the SalesOrder message to trigger:Inventory Service to reserve stock.Finance Service to draft an invoice.Support Service to send an order confirmation email.Synchronous APIs:Technology: Django REST Framework (DRF).10Purpose: For direct, immediate data requests (e.g., Sales Service needs to instantly check the Customer's Credit Limit from the Finance Service).🚀 3. End-to-End Features & Integration PointsThe true value lies in the automated data synchronization between the CRM and ERP components.End-to-End WorkflowCRM ServiceERP ServiceIntegration MechanismQuote-to-Cash CycleSales Service creates a Quote.Inventory Service validates stock availability synchronously.Direct API Call (DRF)Order FulfillmentSales Service marks Quote as "Closed Won".Order Service creates a Sales Order; Finance Service creates an Invoice.Asynchronous Event (Celery)360° Customer ViewSupport Service views contact.Finance (Outstanding Invoices), Order (History), Inventory (Products Purchased).Data Aggregation via API Gateway/Internal APIsCustomer Data SyncContact Service updates a customer's address.Finance Service and Order Service databases are updated immediately.Asynchronous Event (Celery)Would you like to drill down into the data schema for a key entity, such as the Customer/Account, to see how the services would share that data?
