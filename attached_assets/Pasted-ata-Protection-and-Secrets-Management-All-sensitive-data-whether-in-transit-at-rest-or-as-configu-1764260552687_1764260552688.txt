ata Protection and Secrets Management
All sensitive data, whether in transit, at rest, or as configuration, must be encrypted.

Encryption In Transit (TLS 1.3): All external and internal communication must use Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3).

Encryption At Rest (AES-256): All data in your PostgreSQL databases, document storage (Azure Blob Storage), and Redis cache should be encrypted using AES-256. Leverage Azure's Disk Encryption and database transparency features.

Secrets Management: Never hardcode credentials (database passwords, API keys) in code or environment variables. Use a dedicated secret manager like Azure Key Vault to store and dynamically inject secrets into your Kubernetes pods at runtime.

4. 💻 Application Security (Secure Coding)
These measures prevent the most common vulnerabilities listed in the OWASP Top 10.

Input Validation & Output Encoding:

Injection Prevention: Use Django's ORM and prepared statements to prevent SQL Injection. Validate and sanitize all user input server-side.

XSS Prevention: Encode all data rendered on the React frontend to prevent Cross-Site Scripting. Modern React frameworks handle much of this automatically, but it must be manually verified.

Vulnerability & Dependency Scanning: Integrate automated security scanning tools (e.g., Bandit for Python, Snyk/Trivy for Docker images) into your CI/CD pipeline (DevSecOps). The pipeline must fail if critical vulnerabilities are found in any third-party library or container base image.

Session Management: Since you use JWTs, the sessions are stateless. To handle logout, you must implement a Token Blacklisting mechanism using Redis to immediately invalidate compromised or expired Refresh Tokens.

5. 🔭 Observability and Incident Response
You need the tools to detect, respond to, and recover from a breach.

Centralized Logging and Auditing: Aggregate logs from all eight microservices, the API Gateway, and Kubernetes into a centralized system (e.g., ELK Stack or Azure Monitor). Logs must capture all authentication failures, permission denials (403 errors), and data modifications.

Intrusion Detection/Monitoring: Set up real-time alerts for anomalous behavior, such as:

A single user account attempting hundreds of failed logins.

The Finance Service suddenly making many external network calls.

A massive spike in database queries from the Inventory Service outside of business hours.

Incident Response Plan (IRP): Have a documented plan outlining the steps to take when a critical security alert fires, including communication protocols, isolation procedures (e.g., shutting down a compromised microservice), and reporting requirements.
