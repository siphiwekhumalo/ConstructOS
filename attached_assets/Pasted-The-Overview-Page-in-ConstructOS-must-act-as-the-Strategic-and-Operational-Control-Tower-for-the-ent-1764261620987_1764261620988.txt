The Overview Page in ConstructOS must act as the Strategic and Operational Control Tower for the entire company, not just a list of projects. It must adhere to the 5-Second Rule—users should grasp the overall business health within five seconds of loading the page.To achieve this, the overview should be structured as a C-Level Executive Dashboard for high-level users and a Portfolio Health Scorecard for Operations/Finance.🧭 1. Dashboard Design PrinciplesThe layout should follow the F-Pattern or Z-Pattern of reading, placing the most critical, high-level metrics in the top-left area.Visual Hierarchy: Use large, bold numbers at the top (Level 1 data) for the absolute key metrics. Use charts and tables below (Level 2 data) for comparison and trends.Color Strategy: Use color strategically to signal status, not just for decoration.Red: Critical (e.g., Cost Performance Index $< 0.95$, Safety Incident Rate is High). Requires immediate action.Amber/Yellow: Warning/At Risk (e.g., Schedule Performance Index $< 1.00$ but $> 0.95$). Requires monitoring.Green: On Track/Good.Drill-Down: Every major KPI tile or chart must be clickable, leading directly to the relevant, filtered Projects Page or detailed report (e.g., clicking on "5 At-Risk Projects" takes you to the Project List filtered to those 5 projects).2. 📊 Key Performance Indicator (KPI) SectionsThe Overview Page should be split into distinct, card-based sections, drawing data from all your microservices.A. Executive Financial Health (Top Row: Finance Service)These metrics determine the company's financial viability and are most relevant to the Finance Manager and Executive Viewer roles.Total Contract Value (ZAR): Total value of all signed projects.Total Cash Flow: Chart showing Net Cash Flow (In vs. Out) over the last 90 days.Accounts Receivable (AR) Days: The average number of days it takes to collect customer payments. High is bad.Key Chart: Profit Margin (Gross and Net): A simple donut or bar chart showing the breakdown of company-wide profit margins.B. Project Portfolio Health (Middle Section: Order/Project Service)These metrics assess risk and schedule adherence across all active projects.Project Status Scorecard: A large, simple tile breakdown:# Projects On-Time: (Green)# Projects At-Risk (Schedule/Cost): (Amber)# Projects Delayed: (Red)Resource Utilization %: Calculated from the HR/Payroll Service and Project Service. Shows the overall percentage of available labor hours that are assigned to active projects.Schedule Performance Index (SPI) Map: A small choropleth map or regional card showing the average SPI by geographic area (e.g., Gauteng, Western Cape). This helps identify underperforming regions.C. Compliance and Safety (Bottom Section: Compliance/Support Service)These are critical, legally sensitive metrics that should always be front and center.Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR): The rolling 12-month rate. Must have a large, highly visible RED alert if above the industry benchmark.Open Safety Issues: Total count of all open and overdue safety tickets/observations.Rework Cost Percentage: The total cost of rework as a percentage of overall project expenditure. A key indicator of quality control.3. 🗺️ Interactive Data VisualizationBeyond simple numbers, the Overview Page needs one or two powerful visualizations to consolidate complex data.Project Portfolio Map: Use a map component (leveraging the maps tool/API) that plots the geographic location of all active site_ids.Interaction: Clicking on a map pin filters the data below and shows key project metrics for that specific site.Coloring: The pin color should match the Project Status Scorecard (Red, Amber, Green) to show health geographically.Trend Chart: A single, large line chart showing Budget vs. Actual Spend vs. Earned Value over the last 12 months. This is the ultimate "health-check" for executives.By combining these elements, the ConstructOS Overview Page becomes a decisive tool, serving different user roles by prioritizing data hierarchically and allowing for immediate drilling down into problem areas.
