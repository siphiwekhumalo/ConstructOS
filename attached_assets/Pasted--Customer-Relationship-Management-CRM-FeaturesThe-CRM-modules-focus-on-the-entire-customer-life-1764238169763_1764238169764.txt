Data is synced across microservices to avoid silos.API Gateway + Asynchronous Messaging (Celery/RabbitMQ) to ensure changes in one service (e.g., Customer Address change in Contact Service) propagate immediately to others (e.g., Finance Service).Customization & ConfigurationAbility for users to customize fields, add unique data attributes, and tailor workflows without code changes.Django's flexible model system and a separate service for managing Custom Fields and User Preferences (metadata service).Reporting & Analytics (BI)Real-time Dashboards (like the Power BI integration discussed). Provides cross-module metrics (e.g., "Customer Lifetime Value" combines Sales, Order, and Finance data).Data Warehouse/Data Mart (e.g., PostgreSQL for core analytics) separate from transactional databases. Django/DRF endpoints serving structured data for Power BI.Automation & WorkflowVisual builder (optional) for setting up rules like: "If an Opportunity is marked 'Closed Won', then create a Sales Order, and send a welcome email."Celery Beat for scheduled tasks. Django Signals or a dedicated Workflow Engine microservice (using Python logic) to handle complex, cross-service event triggers.Security & ComplianceRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) to define who can see/edit data across all services. Audit trails and logging for regulatory compliance.Authentication Service manages user roles. Permissions logic (Django's permission system) enforced at the API Gateway and within each individual microservice.The key to your success with Django and Microservices is prioritizing the Integration Points to ensure a smooth, end-to-end process from lead generation in the CRM to final invoicing in the ERP.
