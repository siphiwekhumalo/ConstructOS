Responsive User Interface (UI): Use a front-end framework (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS) to ensure the application works seamlessly on desktop computers, tablets (essential for site use), and mobile phones.
Dashboard and Reporting: A customizable, role-based dashboard that provides a high-level overview of key metrics, alerts, and project statuses (e.g., budget utilization, overdue tasks, safety incidents). Generate printable PDF reports for audits and client presentations.
Email Notifications: Use Django's email capabilities to send automated alerts for task assignments, deadline reminders, safety warnings, and document approvals.
Audit Logs: A secure system to track who made which changes and when, which is crucial for accountability and compliance in the construction industry.
