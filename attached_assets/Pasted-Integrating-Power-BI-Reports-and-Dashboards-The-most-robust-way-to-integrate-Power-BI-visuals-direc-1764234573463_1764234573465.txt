Integrating Power BI (Reports and Dashboards)The most robust way to integrate Power BI visuals directly into your software is by using Power BI Embedded Analytics. This is a set of Azure services and APIs that allows you to embed your Power BI content (reports, dashboards, tiles) into a custom application without requiring users to navigate to the Power BI service.Key Steps for Power BI Embedded AnalyticsDevelop Content: Create your Power BI reports and dashboards using Power BI Desktop, and publish them to a Power BI Workspace (part of the Power BI Service/Fabric).Azure Setup & Authentication:Register a Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) Application: This establishes an identity for your custom software. You'll get a Client ID and potentially a Client Secret.Choose an Embedding Solution:Embed for Your Customers (App Owns Data): This is ideal for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). Your application manages access and owns the data, so end-users don't need a Power BI license. It requires an Azure-based Power BI Embedded capacity (A SKUs) or Power BI Premium capacity.Embed for Your Organization (User Owns Data): Each user needs their own Power BI license (Pro or PPU), and they sign in with their organizational credentials. This is simpler for internal business applications.Generate Embed Token: Your backend application uses the Power BI REST APIs (and the Microsoft Entra token) to generate a secure embed token for the specific report/dashboard you want to display. This token specifies which content the user can access and their permission level (view, edit, etc.).Client-Side Integration: Use the Power BI Embedded Analytics Client APIs (JavaScript/TypeScript SDK) in your frontend application (e.g., a web app) to load the embedded content into an iframe or div element, using the embed token you generated. This allows you to interact with the report, apply filters, and handle events.📈 Integrating Excel (Data and Functionality)Integrating Excel depends on whether you need to view/edit a workbook within your app or simply exchange data with it.1. Data Exchange (Recommended)The most common and clean way to integrate with Excel data is by having your software import or export standardized files.MethodUse CaseImplementationData Import/ExportReading/writing tabular data for user analysis.Use a library in your software's programming language (e.g., EPPlus for C#, openpyxl for Python, or simple CSV/JSON files) to generate/read .xlsx or .csv files.Power Query ConnectionKeeping Excel reports constantly updated with your app's data.Design an API endpoint in your software that serves the data. Users can then use Power Query (Get Data) inside Excel to create a live connection to this API.2. Embedding or Editing WorkbooksIf you need full Excel functionality within your app, you have two primary options, both of which require more complex setup and licensing considerations:Microsoft 365 for the Web Integration (WOPI Protocol):If you are a cloud storage provider or need to enable in-browser viewing/editing, you can integrate with the Office Web Viewers using the WOPI (Web Application Open Platform Interface) protocol. This lets users view and edit Excel files stored on your servers directly in a web browser using the Microsoft 365 editor. This requires meeting specific technical and partnership requirements.Excel Services (Legacy/SharePoint):Historically, Excel Services (primarily in SharePoint Server) offered web-based viewing and programmatic access via a REST API. This is generally considered a legacy approach, especially for new cloud-native applications, and the modern recommendation is to use the methods above or the new Microsoft Fabric platform features.For viewing and editing static Excel files without a full WOPI implementation, some third-party libraries or components exist for various languages (like Java, .NET) that allow you to display and manipulate spreadsheets within your custom application's interface.🔑 Summary of ApproachFor a clean and modern integration:For Visual Analytics: Use Power BI Embedded Analytics (either Embed for Your Customers or Embed for Your Organization).For Data Exchange: Use a combination of robust Data Import/Export of .xlsx or .csv files, and expose data via a Web API so users can connect directly using Excel's Power Query feature for live data analysis.
