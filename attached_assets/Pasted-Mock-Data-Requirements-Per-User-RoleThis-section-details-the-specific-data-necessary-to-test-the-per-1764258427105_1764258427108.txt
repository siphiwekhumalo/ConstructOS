Site Manager / Field WorkerThe key constraint is Geographic/Project Scope.Mock User Data: The Site Manager user must have their user profile linked to a site_id (e.g., SIT-PTA-002).Mock Data:Project/Order Records: 10 records. 5 linked to SIT-PTA-002. 5 linked to a different site (SIT-DBN-003).Employee/Timecard: Records for workers assigned to SIT-PTA-002.Test Case: Site Manager successfully loads the Project Dashboard and sees only the 5 projects linked to SIT-PTA-002.

Create the mock data structure (e.g., using factory_boy). 2. Authenticate the user with the specific role (e.g., using self.client.force_authenticate(user) in Django tests). 3. Assert the expected status_code (200 or 403) and the number of returned item
