Navigation and Interface FeaturesThese features ensure users can move efficiently between the CRM and ERP domains without realizing they're moving between different microservices.Unified Global Search: A single search bar that queries core entities across all services (Contacts, Products, Orders, Tickets). Hitting 'Enter' should immediately show relevant results grouped by entity type.Contextual Side Panel: When viewing a primary entity (e.g., a Contact), the screen includes a persistent side panel that displays related, real-time data fetched from other services.Example: Viewing a Contact shows a summary list of "Open Tickets" (from Support Service) and "Last 5 Invoices" (from Finance Service). A click on a list item opens the full record.Smart Action Buttons: Buttons on a record that change based on the record's status.Example: On a Quote record, the button changes from "Edit Quote" to "Convert to Order" (after approval) and finally to "View Sales Order" (after conversion).Breadcrumbs and Favorites: Standard navigation aids that allow users to easily track their path and save frequently accessed reports or records.✏️ 2. Data Entry and Interaction FeaturesThese features speed up data input and ensure consistency by leveraging the shared database models.Universal Auto-Completion: When entering a Customer Name on a new Sales Order, the system auto-completes the input using the master list from the Contact Service. Selecting the name instantly pulls in the official Billing Address and Payment Terms (from Finance Service).Line Item Selector: When adding a Product to a Quote or Order, the user types the SKU or Name.The system uses the Inventory Service API to fetch the item's details and real-time stock availability synchronously, displaying the information instantly on the screen before the user commits the line item.Interaction: User clicks a '+' button $\to$ Types item name $\to$ Sees a green "In Stock (15 units)" status $\to$ Selects item $\to$ Item details populate.Single-Click Status Updates: Using simple dropdowns or dedicated buttons to update status, which triggers the asynchronous update pipeline (Celery events).Example: Sales Rep changes Opportunity Status from "Proposal" to "Closed Won" with a single click. This click triggers the creation of a Sales Order and an Invoice draft in the background.Inline Editing: Ability to click on a field (like a phone number or a quote description) and edit it directly without loading a separate edit screen.🔁 3. Workflow and Process Automation ClicksThese are the interactions that initiate the major cross-service pipelines."Convert to Order" Button: The critical click on a final Quote record. This single interaction:Validates the final stock level (synchronous API call to Inventory).Creates the Sales Order record (in Order Service).Creates a draft Invoice record (in Finance Service).Updates the original Opportunity status to "Closed Won" (in Sales Service).Sends a confirmation email (via Celery task)."Process Payment" Action: A dedicated action button on the Invoice record (in Finance Service).This action updates the invoice status, updates the Customer's Balance Due in the Finance ledger, and sends an event to the Contact Service to update the customer's payment status, all from one click.Drag-and-Drop Pipeline: In the Sales Service, users interact with the sales pipeline by dragging and dropping an Opportunity card from one column (stage) to the next. This simple interaction updates the record's status and triggers associated actions (e.g., sending a stage-advancement notification).Essentially, the low-level experience should feel like navigating one comprehensive application, where a single, logical click often initiates several complex, secure, and asynchronous actions across the different Django microservices in the background.
