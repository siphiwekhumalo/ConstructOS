That's a great baseline for your projects page. To enhance it from a simple list to a powerful project management dashboard, you need to introduce real-time data visualization, contextual metrics, and flexible viewing options.The goal is to provide actionable insights at a glance so Site Managers and Operations Specialists can instantly identify projects that are at risk (of cost overrun or delay).1. 📊 Key Project Metrics (KPIs) to IntegrateYour current list must be supplemented with calculated metrics from the Finance Service and Order/Project Service. Use React's TanStack Query to fetch these metrics efficiently.MetricSource ServiceVisualizationRationaleProgress VarianceOrder/Project ServiceProgress Bar (e.g., Green for on track, Red for delayed).Shows the difference between Planned Progress vs. Actual Progress. A critical indicator of scheduling health.Cost Variance (CV)Finance ServiceDollar Value/Percentage. Displays $(Budgeted\ Cost - Actual\ Cost)$.A negative number flags a project for potential cost overrun. Note: CV is part of Earned Value Management.Open RFIs/TicketsCompliance/Support ServiceNumber Counter.Highlights projects with outstanding questions or issues that could lead to delays.Cash Flow CurveFinance ServiceSparkline Chart (miniature line chart in the row).Shows the trend of spending over the last 30/60/90 days, essential for the Finance team.Days Until MilestoneOrder/Project ServiceCountdown Tag (e.g., "14 Days").Focuses the Site Manager on the nearest deadline.2. 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements for the List ViewInstead of a static list, transform it into a highly dynamic and scannable data table.A. Scannability and Visual HierarchyColor-Coding the Status: Go beyond text. Use a colored pill/tag for the Status field (e.g., Red for Delayed, Yellow for At Risk, Green for On Schedule). The color should be determined by the Progress Variance KPI.Progress Bars: Use a simple progress bar graphic in the list column to visualize Overall Percentage Complete (). This is much faster to interpret than a number.Sticky Header: Keep the table header visible when scrolling, especially for users reviewing large portfolios.B. Interactive Filtering and CustomizationGlobal Filters: Place prominent filters at the top of the page, powered by your Identity/Contact Service and Order/Project Service data:Filter by Status (Active, Closed, Pending).Filter by Site Manager (User Name).Filter by Location (e.g., Province/City).Search/Sorting: Allow users to search by Project Name or Project ID. Allow sorting by critical metrics like Cost Variance (to find the most expensive projects first) or Days Until Milestone.Configurable Columns: Give users the ability to show or hide less-critical columns. A Finance Manager might prioritize Cost Variance and Budget, while a Site Manager prioritizes Open RFIs and Milestone Dates.C. Viewing ModesProvide alternatives to the standard list to cater to different operational needs:View ModePrimary UserPurposeList/Table ViewFinance, OperationsIdeal for comparison, sorting, and bulk actions (e.g., reviewing all invoices for a set of projects).Kanban BoardSite ManagerIdeal for workflow and task management. Each column could represent a Project Milestone (e.g., Foundation, Framing, Finishes).Timeline/Gantt ViewOperations SpecialistIdeal for scheduling and resource allocation. Visually shows project dependencies and schedule variance.3. 🖱️ Drill-Down CapabilityThe Project List should act as the Portfolio Dashboard. When a user clicks on a project, they must drill down into the detailed Project Dashboard View, which features:Detailed Financials: Full budget breakdown by cost code.Document Management: Links to all associated documents (invoices, permits, photos) stored in the Document/Asset Service.Sub-Task List: A granular list of tasks managed by the Field Worker role.By integrating these metrics and UI/UX features, your projects page will transition from a simple data repository to a core operational tool that drives decision-making.A comprehensive guide on dashboard design can help you implement these features effectively.
