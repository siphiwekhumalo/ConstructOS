Building a complete CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system with Django and Python requires a Microservices Architecture. This approach separates the huge application into smaller, independent, and manageable services, ensuring scalability and flexibility.🏛️ Microservices Architecture & Component BreakdownThe core of your backend setup is the segmentation of business domains into separate Django projects (microservices) that communicate via APIs.CRM Core MicroservicesMicroserviceCore ResponsibilityKey Models & APIsSales ServiceManaging the sales pipeline and opportunities.Lead, Opportunity, SalesPipelineStage.

API Gateway (Frontend to Backend)Purpose: The single entry point for all frontend client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate microservice, handles authentication, and performs rate limiting.Technology: Can be built using a lightweight Python framework (like FastAPI or Flask) or a dedicated service (Nginx/Kong). The gateway should translate the public URL (/api/v1/leads) to the internal service URL (http://sales-service:8001/leads).
